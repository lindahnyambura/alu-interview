# Minimum Operations Task

## Overview
This Python script calculates the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters in a file. The script provides a method, `min_operations`, which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the minimum number of operations.

## Script Files
- **0-minoperations.py:** Contains the implementation of the `min_operations` function.
  
## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the desired main file (e.g., `main_0.py`) to test the `min_operations` function.

### Example
```bash
python main_0.py

## Files

0-minoperations.py:
Defines the min_operations function.
Implements the get_hcf function to calculate the highest common factor.

main_0.py:
Tests the min_operations function with specific values of n.
